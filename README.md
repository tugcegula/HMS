## Project Description

The Hospital Management System allows patients to schedule appointments, doctors to manage appointments, track patient medical records, and manage hospital staff (including doctors and nurses). This application utilizes **Spring Boot** for the backend and **PostgreSQL** for data storage.

### Key Features:
- **Doctor Management**: Manage doctor information, specialties, and working hours.
- **Patient Management**: Track patient information, medical history, and health status.
- **Appointment System**: Patients can schedule appointments with doctors, and doctors can view/manage them.
- **Medical Records**: Track patient health history, treatment notes, and prescriptions.
- **User Management**: Manage hospital staff (doctors, nurses, administrative personnel).
- **Security**: User authentication, password security, and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Getting Started

This section outlines the steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Requirements
To run this project, you need the following software:

- **Java 8**
- **Spring Boot**
- **PostgreSQL** 
- **Maven** 
- **IntelliJ IDEA** 

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/hospital-management-system.git
   cd hospital-management-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   If you are using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   If you are using Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **PostgreSQL Database Setup**

   Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure the connection details in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

   **Example `application.properties` configuration**:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/hms
   spring.datasource.username=your-username
   spring.datasource.password=your-password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
   ```

4. **Start the Application**

   After the setup, start the application using one of the following commands:

   If you are using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   If you are using Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

   The application will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

### User Login

The application requires authentication. Use the following default login credentials for the initial setup:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### API Endpoints

The system exposes various API endpoints to manage hospital data. Below are some of the key endpoints:

#### 1. **List Doctors**:
- **GET** `/api/doctors`
- Returns: A list of all doctors.

#### 2. **Add New Patient**:
- **POST** `/api/patients`
- Required Data:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "identityNo": "12345678901",
    "birthDate": "1990-05-10",
    "gender": "Male"
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Create Appointment**:
- **POST** `/api/appointments`
- Required Data:
  ```json
  {
    "patientId": 1,
    "doctorId": 2,
    "appointmentDate": "2024-12-15T10:30:00"
  }
  ```
